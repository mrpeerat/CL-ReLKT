## Motivation
Cross-Lingual Retrieval Question Answering (CL-ReQA) is concerned with retrieving answer documents or passages to a question written in a different language. A common approach to CL-ReQA is to create a multilingual sentence embedding space such that question-answer pairs across different languages are close to each other. 

In this paper, our goal is to improve the robustness of multilingual sentence embedding (yellow box) that works with a wide range of languages, including those with a limited amount of training data. Leveraging the generalizability of knowledge distillation, we propose a Cross-Lingual Retrieval Language Knowledge Transfer (CL-ReLKT) framework.

## How to train

### Requirement
- Tensorflow >= 2.5.0
- tensorflow_text >= 2.5.0 

### Step1: Triplet loss warmup step 
- Run [warmup.sh](1_use_finetune_warmup.sh)
- In this step, we finetune the mUSE model with our training data (i.e., XORQA, MLQA, or XQUAD), where the anchor is the question, the positive is the answer to the question, and the negative is obtained from bm25.

### Step2: Triplet loss online training
- Run [teacher.sh](2_use_finetune_teacher.sh)
- In this step, we continue to finetune the model in Step 1 by using triplet loss and the concept of online mining (negative mining technique).Â 

### Step3: Language Knowledge Transfer (Distillation)
- Run [distillation.sh](3_use_finetune_distillation.sh)
- In this step, we initialize the model's weight from Step 2 and finetune it with the language knowledge transfer technique (Section 2.2).
- We use 3 terms minimization such as question(English)-question(Non-English), document-document, document-question(non-English) as shown in the figure:
